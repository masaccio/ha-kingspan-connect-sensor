# Kingspan Connect Sensor integration for Home Assistant

This repository contains a Home Assistant integration for the [Kingspan SENSiT sensors](https://www.kingspan.com/gb/en-gb/products/tank-monitoring-systems/remote-tank-monitoring/sensit-smart-wifi-tank-level-monitoring-kit) to read levels from an oil tank. The integration relies upon a connection to Kingspan's cloud service.

This integration is derived from the [Home Assistant custom integration blueprint](https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint) with tests derived from [pytest-homeassistant-custom-component](https://github.com/MatthewFlamm/pytest-homeassistant-custom-component).
