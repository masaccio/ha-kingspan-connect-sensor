# Kingspan Watchman SENSiT integration for Home Assistant

This repository contains a Home Assistant integration for the [Kingspan Watchman SENSiT sensors](https://www.kingspan.com/gb/en-gb/products/tank-monitoring-systems/remote-tank-monitoring/sensit-smart-wifi-tank-level-monitoring-kit) to read levels from an oil tank. The integration relies upon a connection to Kingspan's cloud service.
